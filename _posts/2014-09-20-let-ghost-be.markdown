After 2 days full of talks at [From the Front](http://2014.fromthefront.it/), I'm happily back to work (on saturday, duh).

There were lots of interesting talks and some ideas that needs to be metabolized - not an easy 'show your code' conference for sure! :-)

On a lighter side, what I couldn't resist to do after a couple of beers with friends, was updating my blog from wordpress to ghost.

Why?

Because it's minimal, because I love editing posts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and I find that WYSIWYG editors produce shitty HTML, and because it's on nodejs.

Thanks to [Jon Hanshaw](http://blog.henshaw.me/ghost-blogging-essentials/) for the tips on the essentials customizations.

Now to sleep!
