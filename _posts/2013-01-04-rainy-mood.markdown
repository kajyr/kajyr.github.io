This site it's incredible.

Basically it has rain-in-the-forest recording that loops. You have to listen to it with (a good pair of) headphones, and it will make you think that you are in a forest, during a storm (except you don't get wet).

I've discovered it a years ago, more or less, and I am always keeping it open when I work. It is a great way to isolate you acoustically and concentrate, without the distraction that random music with lyrics brings.

And, as a bonus, when the summer it's really hot (and in Bologna can be really hot), tricks your brain and makes the day bearable.
