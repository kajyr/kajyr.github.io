One in a while ( I said _week_ ?) a friend of mine phones, mostly the one i did not hear for a long time, just to chat and ask me advice on their fallen hard disk, bricked smartphone or whatelse.

I am glad to thank Giorgio, that has pinned the problem and made a website around it: [shouldiaskmytechfriendtofixmypc](http://shouldiaskmytechfriendtofixmypc.com/)

(Yes, there's a reference to [dwsntletsieb](http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/) ).

Thanks Giorgio
